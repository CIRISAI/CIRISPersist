# The second device — v50.0.0 (CIRISPersist#919, #916, #920, #917)

Status: LOCKED 2026-09-26 (operator: "evaluate the impact … if everything looks good, lock it in and proceed"). Persist's release lead evaluated each interpretation against CC RC5, the FSDs and the shipped code; every one turned out to be already decided there, so this document records the basis and the build, not a new ruling.

The theme: CIRISServer's second-device flow ("sign in on a second device by approving on the first; files and chats just show up") was blocked three ways in persist, and CIRISEdge's attributed sync door booked a duplicate as a refusal. All four are one MAJOR because #920 and #917 change signatures.

## 0. The four interpretations, their basis, and their impact in practice

| # | Interpretation | Basis (already decided) | Impact in practice |
|---|---|---|---|
| #919 | A row naming a cohort target is never a widening candidate. | CC 5.2 structural invisibility applies to self/family; CC 3.1.9: `cohort_scope` is the emitter's per-envelope choice; `build_widening` (#801) carries the NEW placement's target, so a federation widening naming no room is correct. #530's repair is for rows STRANDED without a placement (traces, which name no room). | The self-room handshake (KeyPackage/Welcome/Commit) stays in the room; a second device joins. Family rows can no longer leave the family. #530's trace repair is unchanged: traces name no room. No wire change, no hash moves. |
| #916 | A member's new device receives exactly what the member holds. | CC 2 `history_on_join` governs a NEW MEMBER; CC 4.4.3.4.5 Option A: entitlement is what the member held during membership; the built self/family precedent `rekey_for_newcomers` grants a newcomer every blob the cohort already holds, idempotently. | History opens on the second device. A removed member's device gets nothing (the fold says not active). An evicted epoch is `ContentMiss`, fail-honest (CC 5.1 P4). Authority is the owner-binding, never the roster: the member's standing does not change. |
| #920 | On a software host the MLS-state key derives from the persisted software content master; the opener returns the custody kind. | `BLOB_ENCRYPTION_AT_REST.md` §4.3/§10.2: "a software fallback honest about being software"; `ContentMasterSource::SoftwareFallback`, `federation_content_master.key_kind`. CC 4.2.2.1: `hardware_class` is a measured claim; software is a class, not a failure. v49's opener departed from this (persist's error). | CI and dev hosts get a durable, truthfully labelled store. Hardware hosts (hardware row) are unchanged. One case moves: a TPM host whose row says SOFTWARE and that already holds a v49 store (CIRISEdge v32.1.0 keyed it from the hardware seed regardless of the row). v50 tries the software key first and then, never minting, the v49 hardware key; the store opens reported `hardware` with a `legacy-v49-hardware-keyed-under-software-row` descriptor and is not re-keyed. One root per posture (no seed file — that would be a third root on software hosts). `HardwareCustodyUnavailable` stays for §11.7 only. The opener's shape changes (MAJOR). |
| #917 | `put_attestation_synced` returns the typed `ReplicatedAttestationOutcome`. | Persist's own rule: clean-break API changes, bundled into the feature cut. Not a CC question. | Edge's ledger books a decoration-only re-delivery as a duplicate on both doors. The peer-origin metering is kept. Return type changes (MAJOR). |

Also locked, built elsewhere: #914 — disclosure sets are blobs (the ruling is on the issue; the store is the cut after v50). #751 closed as ruled 2026-08-19. #912's per-membership listing span is the CC's own wording (CC 2 field table) and stands as shipped in v49.

## 1. #919 — the sweep never widens a placed row

**Defect.** `list_widening_candidates` selects every `tier='federation' AND cohort_scope IN ('self','family')` row with no widening yet; the sweep (`Engine::promote_consented_backlog`, the widening-candidates pass) widens each to the audience of a covering grant, and the widening carries the new placement's target — none, for `federation`. A row `share` placed in a self room (`community_key_id = <owner>`, `cohort_scope = self`) is therefore re-published federation-wide without its room seconds later, and the room's own fold (`supersedes` stands for the claim, CC 4.4.3.3.1) finds nothing.

**Rule.** A candidate is a row whose signed envelope names NO cohort target (`admission::COHORT_TARGET_ENVELOPE_FIELDS`: `community_id`, `community_key_id`, `cohort_key_id`, `family_key_id`). The exclusion is applied in the same place on all three backends (sqlite, postgres, memory), by the same predicate, and the read is documented as "stranded rows only".

**Invariant I186** (memory, sqlite, postgres): a self-scoped row naming a self room plus a federation consent grant covering its dimension → after the sweep the row is unchanged and has no widening; a family-scoped row naming a family, same grant → unchanged; a self-scoped row naming NO target, same grant → widened (the #530 case still repairs). Also: the room's own reader still finds the placed row after the sweep.

## 2. #920 — the MLS-state root follows the content master

**Rule.** The MLS-state key = HKDF(root, `MLS_STATE_CONTEXT`) where `root` is what `content_master_key` / the persisted `federation_content_master` row resolves to on this host: the hardware-sealed seed (`key_kind='hardware'`) or the persisted software master (`key_kind='software'`). The persisted row wins (§10.2): a store created on a software host keeps opening after a TPM appears.

**Shape.** `Engine::open_mls_state(path) -> Result<(XChaChaKvStore, MlsStateCustody), _>` (or the equivalent on the backend), where `MlsStateCustody { kind: "hardware" | "software", descriptor }` is returned so hosts log the class by name. The bare `XChaChaKvStore::open_mls_state(path)` of v49 is REMOVED (clean break; it could only refuse on software hosts). `KVError::HardwareCustodyUnavailable` is kept for exactly the §11.7 case: the row says hardware and the seed is unreachable.

**Seed policy (as built — changed from v49).** First-open-may-seal is NOT kept for the MLS-state opener: under a hardware row it asks `create_seed_if_absent = false` on every open, including the first open of an empty store. The row proves a seed was sealed when it was written; an absent seed is §11.7's lost keyring, and minting there would also move the content master. The only in-process moment a seed is sealed is the content-master row's initialisation (which `open_mls_state` performs on a node with no row), and a process-wide lock in `secrets::hardware` serializes that exists-then-store so concurrent first writers seal one seed.

**v49 compatibility.** Under a software row, only when the store is in use and its verifier refuses the software-derived key, the opener tries v49's key, HKDF(hardware seed, `MLS_STATE_CONTEXT`), with `create_seed_if_absent = false`. On success: `kind = hardware`, descriptor `legacy-v49-hardware-keyed-under-software-row …`, nothing re-keyed. Both keys failing is `WrongPassphrase`. A fresh store under a software row is always `software`.

**Invariant I187**: on a software content master the store opens, reports `software`, survives a reopen, and derives a DIFFERENT key from the content master itself (domain separation); on a hardware row with no reachable seed it refuses `HardwareCustodyUnavailable` and writes nothing; the hardware branch over the storage double reports `hardware`; a software-created store reopens after the row is unchanged even when hardware becomes available (the row wins).

## 3. #916 — a member's new device gets what the member holds

**Door.** `rekey_community_member_device_add(community_key_id, member_key_id, new_occurrence_key_id, authority)` on every backend, orchestrated in `at_rest_cascade` beside `rekey_family_member_add` / `rekey_self_occurrence_add`. It re-wraps to the new occurrence's content-KEM key every retained `(community, epoch)` DEK the member already holds a grant on (per-minter epochs, #848), idempotently (a grant already present is skipped). No epoch bump: the member set did not change.

**Authority.** The new occurrence must be bound to the member by the member's owner-binding (CONSENT_BY_HUMANS `for_key_id`; OCCURRENCE_PRINCIPAL), and the member must be ACTIVE by `authorized_community_roster_at` at the call's instant. A device claimed by a different owner, an unbound occurrence, a removed member, or an occurrence lacking `encryption_pubkeys` is refused by name (typed), never granted a plaintext fallback.

**Invariant I188** (memory, sqlite, postgres): a member with grants on epochs E1..E3 adds a device → the device holds grants on E1..E3 and can unwrap each; re-running adds nothing; a device bound to ANOTHER owner is refused; a removed member's device is refused; an epoch the node no longer retains is reported, not silently skipped.

## 4. #917 — the attributed sync door has a typed pre-write outcome

**Change.** `put_attestation_synced(record, peer)` runs `plan_replicated_attestation_apply` over `(existing, incoming)` and acts on the plan, returning `ReplicatedAttestationOutcome` (`Inserted` / `Unchanged` / `Deduplicated` / `Refused { reason }`) — the same enum the unattributed door returns — while keeping the `peer` argument and `shares_cohort_with(peer)` metering. A same-signed-assertion, different-decoration re-delivery is `already_present_identical` (a duplicate), never `Error::Conflict`; a different signed row is `conflicting_attestation`. `AttestationOutcome` remains for `put_attestation`.

**Invariant I189** (memory, sqlite, postgres): the same bytes through both doors yield the same outcome variant; a decoration-only re-delivery is `Deduplicated` on the attributed door; a different signed row under the same id is `Refused { conflicting_attestation }`; metering still refuses a non-cohort peer.

## 5. Not in scope

#914's store, `erase_object` and mint API (the next cut). Server#650's roster-book read. The `listed_members` capsule op (Server has not asked).

## 6. Verification

Per slice: witnesses RED first, then green on every backend; a mutation round on the new predicate/door (table appended below by the slice); an independent review against this document. Release: the full unfiltered lanes (sqlite, postgres, union), the gate chain, `certify.sh full` on the exact SHA.

## 7. Mutation tables (appended by each slice)

### #920 — the MLS-state root follows the content master

**Opener:** `Engine::open_mls_state(&self, path: impl AsRef<Path>) -> Result<(XChaChaKvStore, MlsStateCustody), KVError>` (async; gated on `encrypted-kv`), where `MlsStateCustody { kind: MlsStateCustodyKind /* Hardware | Software */, descriptor: String }` and `kind.as_str()` is `"hardware"` / `"software"`. It reads, or initialises, the row through the new `BlobStorage::load_or_init_content_master_row` (sqlite, postgres; `load_or_init_content_master` now resolves that row), then calls `XChaChaKvStore::open_mls_state_from_row` (`pub(crate)`, no backend import) on the blocking pool. v49's `XChaChaKvStore::open_mls_state(path)` is removed. The error type is `KVError`, so hosts match `HardwareCustodyUnavailable` directly; a row-load failure is `KVError::Backend`.

**Mechanism.** Both arms call CIRISVerify's `derive_symmetric_key` (HKDF-SHA-256, verify's salt, `info = MLS_STATE_CONTEXT`). The software arm passes the persisted master through an in-process, read-only, one-entry `SecureBlobStorage` that reports `is_hardware_backed() == false`. So the two arms share one mechanism and differ only in the root, and persist implements no KDF of its own.

**Deviation from §2.** §2 said first-open-may-seal is unchanged. It is not. Under a `hardware` row the opener asks `create_seed_if_absent = false` on every open, including the first open of an empty store. The row's existence proves a seed was sealed when the row was written. An absent seed is §11.7's lost keyring, and minting there would also move the content master and orphan the corpus. So the only moment a seed may be sealed is the content-master row's own initialisation, which `open_mls_state` performs on a node with no row. `open_rooted` still reports `first_open` and the I184 witnesses stand, but nothing grants a mint from it.

Lane: `scripts/pg_test_db.sh -- cargo nextest run -j 3 --features postgres,sqlite,encrypted-kv,secrets -E 'test(i184) | test(i187) | test(mls_state) | test(domain_separated) | test(content_master)'`. Baseline: 24/24 pass. Each mutant was applied to a clean committed tree and reverted before the next.

| # | Mutant | Result | Killed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | software arm derives under `CONTENT_MASTER_CONTEXT` (collides with the content domain) | KILLED 23/24 | `i187_b_the_mls_key_is_domain_separated_from_the_content_master` |
| M2 | software arm reports `kind: Hardware` | KILLED 18/24 | i187_a, i187_e, and the sqlite and postgres Engine legs `software_row_opens_as_software` and `no_row_initialises_it_and_reports_its_kind` |
| M3 | §11.7 refusal replaced by minting (`hardware(true)`) | KILLED 21/24 | `i187_c_…refuses_and_writes_nothing`, `i187_c_a_present_tpm_with_an_absent_seed_never_mints`, `i187_d_…reopen_never_mints` |
| M4 | the row-wins rule dropped (hardware preferred when available) | KILLED 20/24 | i187_a, i187_b, i187_e, `i187_a_malformed_row_refuses` |
| M5 | v49's policy restored: may mint on a store's first open (`hardware(!path.exists())`) | KILLED 21/24 | the two i187_c legs and i187_d |
| M6 | software arm uses the content master verbatim (no HKDF) | KILLED 21/24 | i187_b, and the sqlite and postgres `software_row_opens_as_software` legs |

6/6 killed. The postgres legs ran against a fresh database under `pg_test_db.sh`, taking about 1.3–1.5 s each, so they did not pass vacuously. On this host `CIRIS_DATA_DIR` is unset, so the door-level hardware-row leg measured the refusal rather than skipping. The hardware arm is witnessed deterministically over `secrets::hardware::test_doubles::FakeHardwareStorage` through `derive_with_storage`, which is now `pub(crate)`.
